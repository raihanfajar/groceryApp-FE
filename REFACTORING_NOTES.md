# CreateDiscountForm Refactoring Summary

## Before

- **Lines of code**: 478 lines
- **Structure**: Single monolithic component with all logic and UI

## After

- **Main component**: 176 lines (63% reduction)
- **Modular structure**: Split into 5 smaller components + 1 custom hook

## New File Structure

### Main Component

`CreateDiscountForm.tsx` (176 lines)

- Manages form state
- Handles submission logic
- Orchestrates child components

### Child Components

1. **BasicInfoFields.tsx**
   - Name, description, discount type
   - Value type and amount
   - Max discount amount (for percentage)

2. **ConditionalFields.tsx**
   - Minimum transaction value (for MINIMUM_PURCHASE type)
   - BOGO fields (buy/get quantities, max sets)

3. **ProductSelection.tsx**
   - Product list with checkboxes
   - Select all functionality
   - Loading and error states

4. **StoreAndDateFields.tsx**
   - Store selection (Super Admin only)
   - Start/end dates
   - Usage limits

### Custom Hook

**useDiscountFormData.ts**

- `useProducts()` - Fetches products with admin/public fallback
- `useStores()` - Fetches stores for Super Admin

## Benefits

✅ **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
✅ **Reusability**: Components can be reused in edit/view forms
✅ **Testability**: Easier to test individual components
✅ **Readability**: Main component shows clear form structure
✅ **Performance**: Can optimize individual components separately

## Component Props Pattern

All components follow a clear pattern:

- Receive current values as props
- Provide onChange callbacks to parent
- Self-contained UI logic
